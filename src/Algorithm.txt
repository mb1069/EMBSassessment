Algorithm outline

Begin listening
Record initial time
Receive beacon:
	
	if no beacons received on this channel for more than max period and have been listening to channel for more than max period
		Channel.n = beacon.n


	if the two most recent beacons occured during the same cycle
		calculate T as diffT/diffN

	SPECIAL CASE both beacons have same n and channel's N value is known
		calculate T as diffT/(11+b.n)


	if N and T are known
		create both broadcasts
		
	
	If more than 1 broadcast received on channel:
		Calculate possible combinations of N and T that is compatible with known information
		If establish definite N and T
			calculate both broadcasts
		else
			 calculate earliest callback for next series

	else
		If beacon.n ==1 
			Switch channel until next series begins then callback
		else 
			Switch channel for just under T_MIN
