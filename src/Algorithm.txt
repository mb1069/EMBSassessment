Algorithm outline

Begin listening
Record initial time
Receive first beacon:
	if t is known
		Calculate last broadcast
		Shut-off channel/associated sinks
		Switch channel
		
	else if second beacon
		Record beacon
		//SPECIAL CASE FOR N=1 on both beacons
		If N known
			Attempt to find values of I that could predict 2nd broadcast
			If only one valid I
				create both callbacks, delete channel
			If more than 1 valid I
				//TO FIGURE OUT
				Create first broadcast, calculate earliest callback
				Make callback to come back to channel at next wake period (11 t after broadcast)
		IF N not known
			Bart's other equation
			//TO FIGURE OUT IF FROM DIFFERENT CYCLES
	else
		if time elapsed since changing to channel > max period
			Received beacon is the first of the set, therefore set N (for channel) = beacon.n
		Record beacon
		Make callback to come back to channel
