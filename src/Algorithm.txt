Algorithm outline

Begin listening
Record initial time
Receive beacon:
	if time elapsed since changing to channel > max period
		Received beacon is the first of the set, therefore set N (for channel) = beacon.n

	if t is known
		Calculate last broadcast
		Shut-off channel/associated sinks
		Switch channel
		
	else if second beacon
		Record beacon
		//SPECIAL CASE FOR N=1 on both beacons
		
		If N known
		Calculate Period
			create both callbacks, delete channel
		IF N not known
			Create set of possible pairs of n and T, intersect with previous values
			If single possible value, assign to sink and create both broadcasts
			Else:
			Make callback to come back to channel at next wake period (11 t after broadcast)

	else
		Record beacon
		Make callback to come back to channel
